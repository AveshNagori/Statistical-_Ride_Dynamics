Yulu, Indiaâ€™s premier micro-mobility service provider, revolutionizes daily commutes with unique vehicles. Initially driven by a mission to combat traffic congestion, Yulu ensures the safest commuting solutions through a user-friendly mobile app, promoting shared, solo, and sustainable travel.

I delved into understanding the factors influencing demand for shared electric cycles, analyzing a dataset encompassing datetime, weather, ride counts, temperature, and more. My thorough examination involved Bi-Variate Analysis, 2-sample t-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests. The results informed strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing revenues and reducing costs.
